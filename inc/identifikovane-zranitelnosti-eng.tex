\subsection{Identified vulnerabilities}
In this chaper, there are all identified vulnerabilities sorted by their severity from the most severe to the least. All these vulnerabilities were identified during penetration testing. Each vulnerability text contains description of finding, its risks to the security of application and recommendations for mitigating risks. Due to the nature of penetration test, list of vulnerabilities might not be complete.

Because unauthenticated web penetration test, authenticated web penetration test and penetration test of API were performed, this chapter is split into three subchapters, each containing vulnerabilities of that part of penetration testing. In case of unauthenticated and authenticated web penetration test, vulnerabilities fall under such subchapter during which phase of testing they were identified. Chapters are not split based on unauthenticated/authenticated attacker exploitability.
