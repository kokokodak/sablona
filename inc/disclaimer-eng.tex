\subsection{Disclaimer}
Penetration test is usually described as exact and complete simulation of attack against given service or application. Despite penetration test and real attack having many common areas, for example tester/attacker knowledge base, used tools and others, there are some important differences, which need to be taken into account. It's mainly time and money constrains in the case of penetration test.

In case of real attack, the attacker can plan and carry out the attack(s) even for months. He can gather all necessary information for successful attack for a long time period. We can't afford such luxury during a penetration test as such penetration test would be financially unbearable and wouldn't bring results in a timely manner.

For these reasons, there is some level of cooperation from the customer needed in case of penetration test, in order to test systems as much as possible within the given time constraints.
