During penetration test we found out that password for new created services is sent in the e-mail together with username. This is generally not considered secure approach as e-mails can be transported in plaintext form and are usually stored in plaintext form.

If attacker gets access to any network or e-mail server through which the e-mail travels, or gains access to customer's e-mail account, either online or to some backups, he can be able to get access to sensitive credentials.

We recommend not using this approach and either not send plaintext credentials in e-mails or requiring that all passwords are changed again after the first use of potentially compromised passwords sent via e-mail.
